CALCULATION CRITERIA OF CODEFORCES CONTESTS:

The points of Codeforces are calculated as follows:
1. Max points is calculated
2. Normal distribution graph is plotted as follws:
	On X-axis: points[0,max_points]
	On Y-axis: frequency(no. of poeple who have secured that point)
3. Weightage is assigned to different values n X-axis as 
   W(0)=0;
   W(max_points)=1;
   W(max_frequency_point)=0.5;
4. Let r=W(users_point) then
	r*=10;
	ans+=r;
5. Insert ans into contribution table beside that user.
